                %Adhering to scalability - a lot is internal development and is only recognizeable in the source code.

            %Our load tests have given us some performance numbers, these numbers can be used to evaluate scalability for a client, laying the groundwork for a scalability analysis.
            %The few faults that exists we know why they exist because of rigerous testing(Jesper mentioned some), and aside from those we are confident that the system works, as a result of our tests running successfully.

            \end{itemize}
